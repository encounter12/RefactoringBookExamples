# Martin Fowler's Refactoring Book Exercises
This repository contains my exercises when reading Martin Fowler's book:  

[Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, 1st Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/)  

--------------------

## Chapter 9: Simplifying Conditional Expressions

### 07. Introduce Null Object
You have repeated checks for a null value. Replace the null value with a null object.  
See: [Before](/NullObject/Before), [After](/NullObject/After) and [Final](/NullObject/Final)  
* **Before** and **After** are source code examples from Martin Fowler's book, **Final** are my improvements and interpretations.

In [Refactoring, 2nd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Signature-dp-0134757599/dp/0134757599/) this refactoring technique is listed as: [Introduce Special Case](https://refactoring.com/catalog/introduceSpecialCase.html)
