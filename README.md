# Martin Fowler's Refactoring Book Exercises
This repository contains my exercises when reading Martin Fowler's book:  

[Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code 1st Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672)  

## 1. Introduce Null Object
You have repeated checks for a null value. Replace the null value with a null object.  
See: [Before](/NullObject/Before), [After](/NullObject/After) and [Final](/NullObject/Final)  
* **Before** and **After** are source code examples from Martin Fowler's book, **Final** are my improvements and interpretations.
