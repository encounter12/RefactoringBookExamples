# RefactoringBookExamples
This repository contains my exercises when reading Martin Fowler's Refactoring Book

## 1. Introduce Null Object
You have repeated checks for a null value. Replace the null value with a null object.  
See: [Before](/NullObject/Before), [After](/NullObject/After) and [Final](/NullObject/Final)  
* ***Before*** and ***After*** are source code examples from Martin Fowler's book, ***Final*** are my improvements and interpretations.
